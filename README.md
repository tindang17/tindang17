## Hello! I'm Tin Dang

As a curious and analytical person, I have a passion for discovering correlations, patterns, and trends by analyzing data. Data by itself is meaningless. I love transforming data into information. I also have a technical and strategic mindset to solve challenges that occur in my role as a web developer. I’m capable of managing multiple projects at the same time. 

### Skills:
* SQL: CTE, Join, Windon Functions, Subqueries, T-SQL
* Database/Data Warehouse: SQL Server, MySQL, BigQuery
* Data Visualization: Tableau
* Python: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup
* R: tidyverse, ggplot
