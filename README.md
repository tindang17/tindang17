## Hello! I'm Tin Dang
### I'm a Data Analyst

As a curious and analytical person, I have a passion for discovering correlations, patterns, and trends by analyzing data. Data by itself is meaningless. I love transforming data into information. I also have a technical and strategic mindset to solve challenges that occur in my role as a web developer. Iâ€™m capable of managing multiple projects at the same time.
